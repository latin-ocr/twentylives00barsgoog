The Poems of Ovid

This edition consists of about three thousand verses, with a
complete commentary, and about one thousand verses for rapid
reading, with brief notes. The selections from the Metamor-
phoses, which form the greater part of the book, are put first,
and are more fully annotated than the selections from the ofyr
writings. Assistance is judiciously given in explanation of
grammatical matters and in the interpretation of the myths,
while special attention is called to the force of the Latin word-
order‚ and frequent aid is given for making a correct and fiuent
English rendering. A brief summary of the general laws of
prosody is given in the introduction, together with copious
exercises, and all long vowels are indicated in the earlier
selections.

Marem Tullius Cicero

Ten orations are here presented-the four against Catiline, 3
those on the Manilian Law, for the poet ArchiaS, and for Milo,
the Fourteenth Philippic‚ and those for Marcellus and for Liga-
rius. The orations selected are such as will satisfy the entrance

requirements of any college or university in the United States

The Introduction treats in a comprehensive, clear, and inter-
esting way of the life and character of Cicero; of the orations
presented in this edition3 of the letters; and finally, of the r
Roman Constitution, with ‘special reference to its hearing upon
the subject-matter of the orations.

The Notes are the result of many years of class-room experi-
ence. They represent to some extent the need of explanation,
as shown by the questions of students in their daily recitations.

In accordance with the plan of the Series, there are twenty-
five pages of Word-groups. These show the derivation and
relations of Latin words, and are most helpful in acquiring a
vocabulary. ’

The von Minckwitz Cicero contains two maps and over fifty
of the most excellent illustrations. Seven of these illustrations
are full-page.
