1¹56 NOTES

raon 9. suos: here, as there is no danger of ambiguity‚ this word
³2 refers to the subject of its own clause (direct reflear've), and not to
that of the verb of saying (indirect reflexerat-recipere: not
receive, which is generally expressed by accepere, while recepere has
the idea of recovering something formerly in one‘s possession. y
ro. miserant: ind. as being rather an explanatory statement
by the author than a quotation from Themistocles. -renrltterentz
quoted imperative. See note on facerent, p. 31, l. 5. ·

vm. 14. anemurum suffragiis: ostracism (lit. petsherd·
votes). Atarneus, when the rivalry of two prominent public men
seemed likely to cause a deadloclr or threaten the safety of the
state, the people were called together and voted for the banishment
of one or the other. Originally the ballot used was an oyster·shell
(r'lorpurov),⁴ whence the name ostraeism ‚· afterwards a tile or pot-
sherd was used. A man was not ostracised unless at least six .
thousand votes were cast against him. The banishment lasted for
ten years, but involved neither confisoetion of property nor perma-
nent loss ol civic rights. In later times, through abuse and evasion‚
the imperfectiori of ostracism as a remedy for political evils began
to appear, and the custom was abolished.

24. el: dat. of possessor—nospitium: in early times, when
all strangers were regarded as enemim, travellers in foreign lands
were not safe unless protected by the hospitality of some native of
the country. To secure this protectior, or hosptium, they had to be
recommended to their host, either on the score of previous acquaint-
ance and friendly compact, or bya mutual friend himself enjoying
the rights of such a compact. lt was because Themistocles did not
have hospitium with Admetus that he took the precautions described
in the text.
