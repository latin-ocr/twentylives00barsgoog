HISTORY OF ROME ¹3

ships sailed westward over the Mediterranean, even to
the shores of Britain, carrying the manufactures of the
east and exchanging them lor the raw materials which
other countries produced. Everywhere they established
trading postS, many oi which grew into cities. The
greatest and most prosperous oi these was Carthage,
on the north African coast.

About a‘hundred miles northeast of Carthage lay the
rich island of Sicily. In time there sprung up in its

· western hali a number of Carthaginian colonies. The
eastern end was settled by Greeks, with whom the
Carthaginians long and strenuously contended for the
ownership of the island. Finally the Romans were
drawn into the struggle as allies of the Greeks After
years oi hard fighting, during which the Car· 264-241
thaginian general, Hamilcar, at one time Rc·
seemed likely to achieve complete success over the Hamilcar.
Roman arms, the Carthaginians were driven from the
island.

Twenty-three years later the Carthaginians renewed
the conflict. At their head was Hannibal, son of Hamil· Hannibal,
car, bound by an oath to undying enmity
toward the Romans. But though he invaded ²1⁸ Μ’(
Italy and with consummate generalship worsted thel
Romans in battle aiter battle, he could not break the,
Roman power, and finally suffered such reverses that
he had to acknowledge his campaign a iailure. ln
205 Bc. the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio
“carried the war into Africa.” Carthage had no out-
posts of resistance equal to the fortified Italian towns,
