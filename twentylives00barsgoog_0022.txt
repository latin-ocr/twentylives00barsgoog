y the friend ol Nepos.

Besides the history of the world referred to in the
passage from Catullus quoted above, 'Nepos wrote many
other works, allos which are lost, except a portion of
the De Vitas Inlustribus. Of the sixteen or more books
into which this work was divided, we have only one, De
Excellentibus Ducibus Exterarmn Gentium, from which
nearly all the selections in this volume are taken, and
partos another, De Historias Latinis embracing the lives ¹
ol Cato the Censor and of Titus Pomponius Atticus.

The purpose ol the Lz'ves is clear. In a day when

y Roman statecraft was characterized rather by personal
ambition than by patriotism, Nepos felt it wise to re·
mind the menos his time of the lessons of history. This
may, perhaps, explain the form in which he cast his

work. He has made these brief biographies character

⁸ sketches‚ not complete records. The style of Nepos has
certain peculiarities which prevent his being classed
among the writers ol the purest prose. These will
receive attention in the notes when of sufficient impor'-
tance to demand comment.
