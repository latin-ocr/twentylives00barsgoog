one supposes that Epaminondas can free himself from
danger. But he dares not only (non modo) to deny none
of his opponentsâ€™ charges, but even (sedetiam) to speak
so that everybody begins to laugh. He says that he is
going to be condemned to death because he has con-
quered the Spartans and liberated the whole oi Greece.
Even if (etrornsz') the judges are unwilling that he
should go away, they do not dare to cast their votes
against him.

IX. If Epaminondas had not attached the enemy at
Mantinea too boldly, he would not have received a mor-
tal wound. But when the Spartans recognized him,
they made a united attack on him. After Epaminondas
heard that the Spartans were conquered, he said that he
had lived long enough. Then he pulled out the iron,
that he might die.

X. Pelopidas found fault with him because he had
never married. But Epaminondas said that his stock
could not die out, because the battle of Leuctra was his
child.

No one will deny that Epaminondas was unwilling to
stain his hands in the blood of his own [people]. But
he was willing to fight with the Lacedaemonians, and to
stand in the first rank at the Cadmea. If he had not

been at the head of the state, Thebes would always have
been subject t0 a foreign power.

Ii anyone should deny that 'Epaminondas was of more
[account] than the state, do you not think that such a
man could be justly (merz'to) blamed?
