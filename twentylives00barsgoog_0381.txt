charles Aloright Principal os CentralHigh School, Cleveland, otio : You
have a fine text in the new Cicero. The maps and illustrations are most
appropriate and the best Ι have seen. The introducti0n‚ leading the pupil
into something ol a complete knowledge of the social and political atmos-
phere in which Cicero lived and which inspired these orations, is very good.
The “word-'groups’' following the text should be very helplul to any student
of English or Latin. In papcr and type and general appearance you have an
artistic productiora.

wilfrid hay, latin Department, DeWitt Clinton Higlz School, Nero l'ork
City .· I have had the privilege oi using Minckwitz’s edition oi Cicero’s Ora·
tions in my third-year classes and find it peculiarly adapted to high school
worlr. I think it excellent in every way. “

S. lt. Alvord‚ Public High Schoel, Hartsord, Coum: I am much pleased
with the work, and consider it admirably adapted ior use in our preparatory
schools.

Edmtmd D. ὃοοῒῒ, Classical Department, High School, Holyoka Mass. :
Like its predecessors in the same series, this book is a fine example oi the
modern text-book, and the editor seems to have carried out sully the aims set

forth in his introductiom I have particularly admired the directness and
brevity ol the notes.

⁴charles D. Seely, Instructor os Latin and Greek, State Narmal School,

Brockporl, N. Y. : It appears to me a very scholarly book. The introduction

is clear and well-arranged. The pages given to word-groups are valuable, ·

and the notes are such helps as are needed in explaining the text and giving ‘⁷'
a clear understanding oi the author’s thought. ’

1 am particularly pleased with the pictures in the text and the positione in
which they are placed. They cannot fail to be a material help to the student
in picturing to himself the surroundings oi the orations as they were delivered
and the many allusions to ancient Roman life and customs.

Sarah C. Echecli, Teucher os Latin, Higlr School, Watertown, Cena: I
findit an excellent edition in every way, - in introduction, maps, illustrations,
text. Resides this, it is very well bound.

Α Burbanlr, Princa‘pal of High Stheni, Exeter‚ N.H..· Ι am convinced
that it is the best-edited book on the Orations that 1 have seen. The intro·
duction cannot fail to bring the student into the spirit of Cicero’s time, and

the excellent notes must be a valuable aid to the study. The typography ol
the text will commend itseli to all.
